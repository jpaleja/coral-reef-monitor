 Welcome to my Coral Reef Monitor web map application which aims to deliver an interactive experience, focused on offshore East Africa, containing geographic information relating to coral reefs. Coral reefs are found all around the world, from cold Alaskan waters to predominantly warm tropics and subtropics and are host to an abundance of species with around 25% of marine species relying on them for sustenance. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has estimated that only 20% of the ocean floor has been explored therefore the potential for discovering and studying coral reefs is huge. With threats that range widely including pollution, coral bleaching from climate change, coastal development amongst many others, the need to protect them is essential and in developing this web application, I aim to provide a platform to assist in building knowledge on coral reefs.

The structure of using separate html, css and javascript scripts was chosen to allow better management of the code giving more flexibility to put together different functionality and also the page load time is decreased due to caching of the js files. CSS was implemented within the javascript code to allow easier identification of what styling fits particular layers. The ideal usage scenario of the final web application is where, using the tools provided, a user identifies a coral reef of interest, reviews the existing data, adds comments through edited points, lines and polygons and exports the data as a geoJSON file which can be shared to the website host. Users of the site may include the general public who have an interest in coral reefs as part of a citizen science initiative and, scientists and researchers who may have an interest in contributing to and improving data on coral reefs. The conceptual plan was designed to include data of reef locations, coral bleaching locations, geographic extent of marine mammals, towns and offshore exclusive economic zones (EEZ) along with an editing functionality and Google Satellite/Terrain tile basemaps. The data was all cut to the extent of East Africa to demonstrate a pilot area on the web application due to smaller data files having a less risk of slowing or crashing the web application. Many different applications have been developed to utilise the mass publics interest in science, however, in relation to the display of coral reef data, the ReefBase Information System provides a variety of GIS layers for viewing such as locations and information on diseases, alongside photos of individual reefs. However, this does not include a collaborative component that allows users to contribute information which many projects such as Zooniverse have set out to do.

To show the development stages towards the final application this website has three pages documenting the process of development with progressively designed web map applications.
The first step was building the functionality to <a href="/var/www/html/user/map1.html">locate coral reefs>>>></a>
